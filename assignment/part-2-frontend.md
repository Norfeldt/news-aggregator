# Part 2: Frontend (Minimal)

Build a minimal frontend that:

- **Lists the top 20 stories** from your backend
- **Allows clicking a story** to see its details

## Requirements

- Fetch data from your backend API
- Display story list with basic information
- Implement story detail view
- Focus on functionality over aesthetics

## Tech Stack

- You can use **any frontend framework** (React, Vue, etc.)
- Don't worry about styling â€” functionality is key

## Suggested UI Structure

### Story List View
- Display title, score, and author
- Make titles clickable to show details

### Story Detail View
- Show all story information
- Display additional author details (karma, account age)
- Provide way to go back to list
