## 📝 Notes

### Part 1 Accomplishments
- Chose Hono framework for ultrafast performance and edge compatibility
- Implemented all required endpoints with proper error handling
- Added bonus features: caching with TTL, rate limiting, clean architecture
- Created comprehensive README with framework guide and pagination roadmap
- Structured code for easy extension (service layer pattern)

### Quick Wins
- Focus on core functionality first ✅
- Use simple in-memory storage ✅
- Minimal UI is fine
- Document decisions as you go ✅

### Watch Out For
- Don't over-engineer
- Time management is key
- Test basic flows work
- Remember to handle errors gracefully
