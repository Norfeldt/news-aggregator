# Flimmer – Pre-Interview Assignment

Hi!   

Thanks again for your time and interest in joining Flimmer. We're excited to get to know you better.

Ahead of our in-person session, we'd love for you to spend **1–1.5 hours** on this assignment. The task consists of **three parts**: a small coding project, a product/tech design exercise, and a short reflection.

Nothing has to be perfect — we're more interested in how you think and work than in looks.

## Task Overview: Build a Simple News Aggregator Backend with Minimal Frontend

**Goal:**  
Build a small full-stack app that fetches, stores, and displays the top stories from the Hacker News API. The app should include a backend service with a basic API and a minimal frontend that consumes it.

## Assignment Parts

1. **[Part 1: Backend API](./part-1-backend-api.md)** - Build a REST or GraphQL API for news aggregation
2. **[Part 2: Frontend](./part-2-frontend.md)** - Create a minimal frontend to display stories
3. **[Part 3: README & Reflection](./part-3-readme-reflection.md)** - Document your solution and approach

## Additional Tasks

- **[Task 2: Feature Brainstorm](./task-2-feature-brainstorm.md)** - Video reaction feature design
- **[Task 3: Hiring Thoughts](./task-3-hiring-thoughts.md)** - Team building reflection

## Deliverable

Please share a GitHub repo link with your solution before our session.

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with.

See you soon!
